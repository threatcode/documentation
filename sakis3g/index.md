  out-of-the-box for establishing a 3G connection with any
  combination of modem or operator. It automagically setups

  settings. You should try it when anything else fails.

 Sakis3G is a shell script which is supposed to work out-of-the-box for 
 establishing a 3G connection with any combination of modem or operator.
