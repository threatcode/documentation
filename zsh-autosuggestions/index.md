 ### zsh-autosuggestions
 
  As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor
  in a muted gray color. If you press the right-arrow key or End with the
  cursor at the end of the buffer, it will accept the suggestion, replacing
  the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion. If you invoke
  the forward-word widget, it will partially accept the suggestion up to the
  point that the cursor moves to.
