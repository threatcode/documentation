 ### zsh-syntax-highlighting
 
  This package provides syntax highlighting for the shell zsh.  It enables
  highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an
  interactive terminal.  This helps in reviewing commands before running
  them, particularly in catching syntax errors.
   
  This feature is inspired by the Fish shell, which provides it by default.
   
  There are numerous ways to configure the colors used for highlighting,
  and to configure what is highlighted.
