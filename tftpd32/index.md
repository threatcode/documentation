 ### tftpd32
 
  Tftpd32 is a free, opensource IPv6 ready application which includes DHCP, TFTP,
  DNS, SNTP and Syslog servers as well as a TFTP client.
  The TFTP client and server are fully compatible with TFTP option support
  (tsize, blocksize and timeout), which allow the maximum performance when
  transferring the data.
  Some extended features such as directory facility, security tuning, interface
  filtering; progress bars and early acknowledgments enhance usefulness and
  throughput of the TFTP protocol for both client and server.
  The included DHCP server provides unlimited automatic or static IP address
  assignment.
 
 **Installed size:** `590 KB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install tftpd32`
