 ### libdistorm3-3
 
  diStorm3 is a binary stream disassembler library project.
   
  With diStorm3, no more parsing strings is needed. diStorm3 is really a
  decomposer, which means it takes an instruction and returns a binary
  structure which describes it rather than static text. This is great for
  advanced binary code analysis.
   
  This package provides the shared library.
 
 **Installed size:** `88 KB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install libdistorm3-3`
