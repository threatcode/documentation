 ### tetragon
 
  Ciliumâ€™s new Tetragon component enables powerful realtime, eBPF-based Security
  Observability and Runtime Enforcement.
   
  Tetragon detects and is able to react to security-significant events, such as:
     - Process execution events
     - System call activity
     - I/O activity including network & file access
   
  When used in a Kubernetes environment, Tetragon is Kubernetes-aware - that is,
  it understands Kubernetes identities such as namespaces, pods and so-on - so
  that security event detection can be configured in relation to individual
  workloads.
   
  This package contains the tool tetra CLI.
 
 **Installed size:** `42.95 MB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install tetragon`
