 ### ghidra
 
  This package contains a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created
  and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This
  framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools
  that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including
  Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly,
  decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features.
  Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable
  formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may
  also develop their own Ghidra extension components and/or scripts using Java
  or Python.
   
  In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling
  and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and
  extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a
  variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep
  insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential
  vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
