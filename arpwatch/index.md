 ### arpwatch
 
  Arpwatch maintains a database of Ethernet MAC addresses seen on the
  network, with their associated IP pairs.  Alerts the system administrator
  via e-mail if any change happens, such as new station/activity,
  flip-flops, changed and re-used old addresses.
   
  If you want to maintain a list authorized MAC addresses manually, take a look
  at the arpalert package which may fit your needs better.
 
 **Installed size:** `152 KB`

 NAME
        arp2ethers - convert arpwatch address database to ethers file format
 
 SYNOPSIS
        arp2ethers [ arp.dat file ]
 
 DESCRIPTION
        arp2ethers  converts  the  file  /var/lib/arpwatch/arp.dat (or the file
        specified on the command line) into ethers(5) format on  stdout.   Usu-
        ally  arp.dat is an ethernet/ip database file generated by arpwatch(8).
        The arpwatch daemon in Debian will create different  arp.dat  depending
        on  its  configuration.  All of them will be available at /var/lib/arp-
        watch/.
 
 FILES
        /var/lib/arpwatch - default directory for arp.dat
        arp.dat - ethernet/ip address database

 ##### massagevendor
 
 Convert the ethernet vendor codes master list to arpwatch format
 
 ```
 root@kali:~# massagevendor -h
 sed: invalid option -- 'h'
 Usage: sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...
 
   -n, --quiet, --silent
                  suppress automatic printing of pattern space
       --debug
                  annotate program execution
   -e script, --expression=script
                  add the script to the commands to be executed
   -f script-file, --file=script-file
                  add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed
   --follow-symlinks
                  follow symlinks when processing in place
   -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]
                  edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)
   -l N, --line-length=N
                  specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command
   --posix
                  disable all GNU extensions.
   -E, -r, --regexp-extended
                  use extended regular expressions in the script
                  (for portability use POSIX -E).
   -s, --separate
                  consider files as separate rather than as a single,
                  continuous long stream.
       --sandbox
                  operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).
   -u, --unbuffered
                  load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush
                  the output buffers more often
   -z, --null-data
                  separate lines by NUL characters
       --help     display this help and exit
       --version  output version information and exit
 
 If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then the first
 non-option argument is taken as the sed script to interpret.  All
 remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are
 specified, then the standard input is read.
