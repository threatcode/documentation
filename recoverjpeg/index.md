 ### recoverjpeg
 
  recoverjpeg tries to recover JFIF (JPEG) pictures and MOV movies from
  a peripheral. This may be useful if you mistakenly overwrite a partition
  or if a device such as a digital camera memory card is bogus.
   
  This package provides these executables: recoverjpeg, recovermov,
  remove-duplicates and sort-pictures. The remove-duplicates is useful to
  remove duplicate files found. sort-pictures can be used to sort pictures
  according to exif date.
   
  This package acts as a carver (data carving) and is useful in forensics
  investigations.

 Sort pictures according to exif date

 root@kali:~# man sort-pictures
 SORT-PICTURES(1)                                              SORT-PICTURES(1)
 
 NAME
        sort-pictures - sort pictures according to exif date
 
 SYNOPSIS
        sort-pictures
 
 DESCRIPTION
        Sort-pictures uses the exif tags in jpeg pictures recovered by recover-
        jpeg  in  directories.   It  creates hard links to organize sorted pic-
        tures.
 
        Running sort-pictures will scan the current directory for  files  named
        after  the  template  image?????*.jpg  (image followed by at least five
        characters followed by .jpg).  A new hardlink will be created for  each
        file in one of the following directories:
 
        o invalid The picture is an invalid JFIF file.
 
        o small The picture size is less than 100,000 bytes.
 
        o undated Sort-pictures was unable to determine the date of the picture
          from the exif tags.
 
        o YYYY-MM-DD A directory representing the date at which the picture was
          taken.
