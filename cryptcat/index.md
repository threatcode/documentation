 ### cryptcat
 
  Cryptcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across
  network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol while encrypting the
  data being transmitted.
  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly
  or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is a
  feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
  almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
  built-in capabilities.
 
 **Installed size:** `80 KB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install cryptcat`

 ##### cryptcat
 
 Twofish encryption enabled version of nc(1)
 
 ```
 root@kali:~# cryptcat -h
 [v1.10]
 connect to somewhere:	nc [-options] hostname port[s] [ports] ... 
 listen for inbound:	nc -l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]
 options:
 	-g gateway		source-routing hop point[s], up to 8
 	-G num			source-routing pointer: 4, 8, 12, ...
 	-h			this cruft
 	-i secs			delay interval for lines sent, ports scanned
 	-l			listen mode, for inbound connects
 	-n			numeric-only IP addresses, no DNS
 	-o file			hex dump of traffic
 	-p port			local port number
 	-r			randomize local and remote ports
 	-s addr			local source address
 	-u			UDP mode
 	-v			verbose [use twice to be more verbose]
 	-w secs			timeout for connects and final net reads
 	-z			zero-I/O mode [used for scanning]

## cryptcat Usage Example

On the server, listen for a connection (`-l`) on port 4444 (`-p 4444`) and donâ€™t do name resolution (`-n`). Redirect all data to a file (`> dataxfer`). On the client, connect to the remote IP address (`192.168.1.202`) on port 4444 (`4444`) and pipe in the data to be transferred (`< /tmp/juicyinfo)`:

```
root@kali:~# cryptcat -l -p 4444 -n > dataxfer

root@kali:~# cryptcat 192.168.1.202 4444 < /tmp/juicyinfo
```
