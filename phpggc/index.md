 ### phpggc
 
  PHPGGC is a library of payloads exploiting unsafe object deserialization.
  It also provides a command-line tool to generate them.
 
 **Installed size:** `650 KB`

 PHPGGC: PHP Generic Gadget Chains
 ---------------------------------
 
 USAGE
   ./phpggc [-h|-l|-i|...] <GadgetChain> [arguments]
 
 INFORMATION
   -h, --help Displays help
   -l, --list [filter] Lists available gadget chains
   -i, --information
      Displays information about a gadget chain
 
 OUTPUT
   -o, --output <file>
      Outputs the payload to a file instead of standard output
 
 PHAR
   -p, --phar <tar|zip|phar>
      Creates a PHAR file of the given format
   -pj, --phar-jpeg <file>
      Creates a polyglot JPEG/PHAR file from given image
   -pp, --phar-prefix <file>
      Sets the PHAR prefix as the contents of the given file.
      Generally used with -p phar to control the beginning of the generated file.
   -pf, --phar-filename <filename>
      Defines the name of the file contained in the generated PHAR (default: test.txt)
 
 ENHANCEMENTS
   -f, --fast-destruct
      Applies the fast-destruct technique, so that the object is destroyed
      right after the unserialize() call, as opposed to at the end of the
      script
   -a, --ascii-strings
      Uses the 'S' serialization format instead of the standard 's' for non-printable chars.
      This replaces every non-ASCII value to an hexadecimal representation:
        s:5:"A<null_byte>B<cr><lf>"; -> S:5:"A\00B\09\0D";
      This is experimental and it might not work in some cases.
   -A, --armor-strings
      Uses the 'S' serialization format instead of the standard 's' for every char.
      This replaces every character to an hexadecimal representation:
        s:5:"A<null_byte>B<cr><lf>"; -> S:5:"\41\00\42\09\0D";
      This is experimental and it might not work in some cases.
      Note: Since strings grow by a factor of 3 using this option, the payload can get
      really long.
   -n, --plus-numbers <types>
      Adds a + symbol in front of every number symbol of the given type.
      For instance, -n iO adds a + in front of every int and object name size:
      O:3:"Abc":1:{s:1:"x";i:3;} -> O:+3:"Abc":1:{s:1:"x";i:+3;}
      Note: Since PHP 7.2, only i and d (float) types can have a +
   -w, --wrapper <wrapper>
      Specifies a file containing at least one wrapper functions:
        - process_parameters(array $parameters): called right before object is created
        - process_object(object $object): called right before the payload is serialized
        - process_serialized(string $serialized): called right after the payload is serialized
 
 ENCODING
   -s, --soft   Soft URLencode
   -u, --url    URLencodes the payload
   -b, --base64 Converts the output into base64
   -j, --json   Converts the output into json
   Encoders can be chained, for instance -b -u -u base64s the payload,
   then URLencodes it twice
 
 CREATION
   -N, --new <framework> <type>
     Creates the file structure for a new gadgetchain for given framework
     Example: ./phpggc -N Drupal RCE
   --test-payload
     Instead of displaying or storing the payload, includes vendor/autoload.php and unserializes the payload.
     The test script can only deserialize __destruct, __wakeup, __toString and PHAR payloads.
     Warning: This will run the payload on YOUR system !
 
 EXAMPLES
   ./phpggc -l
   ./phpggc -l drupal
   ./phpggc Laravel/RCE1 system id
   ./phpggc SwiftMailer/FW1 /var/www/html/shell.php /path/to/local/shell.php
 
 ```
