 ### linux-exploit-suggester
 
  This package contains a Linux privilege escalation auditing tool. It's
  designed to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given Linux
  kernel/Linux-based machine. It provides following functionality:
    - Assessing kernel exposure on publicly known exploits
  Tool assesses (using heuristics methods discussed in details here) exposure of
  the given kernel on every publicly known Linux kernel exploit. For each
  exploit, exposure is calculated
    - Verifying state of kernel hardening security measures
  LES can check for most of security settings available by your Linux kernel. It
  verifies not only the kernel compile-time configurations (CONFIGs) but also
  verifies run-time settings (sysctl) giving more complete picture of security
  posture for running kernel. This functionality is modern continuation of
  --kernel switch from checksec.sh tool by Tobias Klein.
 
 **Installed size:** `99 KB`
