 ### owasp-mantra-ff
 
  Mantra is a browser especially designed for web application security testing.
  By having such a product, more people will come to know the easiness and
  flexibility of being able to follow basic testing procedures within the
  browser. Mantra believes that having such a portable, easy to use and yet
  powerful platform can be helpful for the industry.
   
  Mantra has many built in tools to modify headers, manipulate input strings,
  replay GET/POST requests, edit cookies, quickly switch between multiple
  proxies, control forced redirects etc. This makes it a good software for
  performing basic security checks and sometimes, exploitation. Thus, Mantra
  can be used to solve basic levels of various web based CTFs, showcase
  security issues in vulnerable web applications etc.
 
 **Installed size:** `119.65 MB`
