 ### owl
 
  This package contains an open implementation of the Apple Wireless Direct Link
  (AWDL) ad hoc protocol for Linux and macOS written in C and part of the Open
  Wireless Link project.
   
  OWL runs in user space and makes use of Linuxâ€™s Netlink API for Wi-Fi specific
  operations such as channel switching and to integrate itself in the Linux
  networking stack by providing a virtual network interface such that existing
  IPv6-capable programs can use AWDL without modification.
 
 **Installed size:** `85 KB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install owl`
