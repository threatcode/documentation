 ### dvwa
 
  This package contains a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its
  main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and
  tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the
  processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to
  learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.
   
  The aim of DVWA is to practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities,
  with various levels of difficulty, with a simple straightforward interface.
  Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities with
  this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as
  many issues as possible.
