 ### grokevt
 
  GrokEVT is a collection of scripts built for reading Microsoft Windows
  NT/2000/XP/2003 event log files.
   
  Currently the scripts work together on one or more mounted Microsoft Windows
  partitions to extract all information needed (registry entries, message
  templates, and log files) to convert the logs to a human-readable format.
   
  This program is useful in forensics investigations.
 
 **Installed size:** `121 KB`  
 **How to install:** `sudo apt install grokevt`

 ```
 root@kali:~# grokevt-addlog -h
 USAGE:
   /usr/bin/grokevt-addlog <DATABASE_DIR> <EVT_FILE> <NEW_TYPE> <BASE_TYPE>

 ##### grokevt-dumpmsgs
 
 A tool for dumping the contents of message databases built previously by grokevt-ripdll(1).
 
 ```
 root@kali:~# man grokevt-dumpmsgs
 grokevt-dumpmsgs(1)                                        grokevt-dumpmsgs(1)
 
 NAME
        grokevt-dumpmsgs - A tool for dumping the contents of message databases
        built previously by grokevt-ripdll(1).
 
 SYNOPSIS
        grokevt-dumpmsgs message-db1 [message-db2 ...]
 
 DESCRIPTION
        grokevt-dumpmsgs  takes  one or more message databases previously built
        with grokevt-ripdll(1) and prints out all entries to  stdout.  This  is
        mainly  a  debugging  tool, but may be useful for analyzing the message
        contents of PE files while developing other applications.
 
 ARGUMENTS
        grokevt-dumpmsgs uses the following arguments:
 
        message-dbN
               If multiple message databases are supplied, entries of all data-
               bases are printed to stdout in the order they are provided.
 
 OUTOUT
        grokevt-dumpmsgs prints each database entry out on a  single  line,  in
        two  comma-separated columns. The first column is the message ID, which
        is in the format:
 
                  XXXX-YYYYYYYY
 
        Here, XXXX represents the message's language  code,  and  the  YYYYYYYY
        represents the message's relative virtual address (RVA) within the mes-
        sage  block of the PE file.  The second column contains the message it-
        self. Messages containing special characters (such as newlines or  com-
        mas)  are  encoded  in the same manner that grokevt-parselog(1) encodes
        them ("%XX" where XX is the hexadecimal value of the character).
 
 BUGS
        Probably several. This  particular  script  has  not  been  extensively
        tested.
